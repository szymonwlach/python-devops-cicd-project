# üêç Python for DevOps: CI/CD for Python Projects

This repository contains the implementation of a complete **CI/CD pipeline** for Python projects, developed as part of the **DevOps course**.  
It showcases how to automate testing, linting, static analysis, building, and publishing Python packages to both **TestPyPI** and **PyPI**.

---

## üöÄ Overview

The project demonstrates a robust, production-ready **CI/CD workflow** using **GitHub Actions**, integrating modern tools for:
- Code quality enforcement
- Static and security analysis
- Automated testing
- Semantic versioning
- Automated publishing on release

---

## üß© Features Implemented

- ‚úÖ Implemented project codebase  
- ‚úÖ Added a **GitHub Actions workflow** (`python-ci.yaml`) for CI/CD  
- ‚úÖ Integrated **linting** with [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff)  
- ‚úÖ Applied **code formatting checks** using [black](https://github.com/psf/black)  
- ‚úÖ Added **type checking** with [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy)  
- ‚úÖ Included **security scanning** via [bandit](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit)  
- ‚úÖ Added **automated testing** with [pytest](https://pytest.org)  
- ‚úÖ Configured **semantic-release** for automated versioning and publishing  
- ‚úÖ Set up publishing to both **TestPyPI** and **PyPI** when a new release is published  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- **Python 3.9 ‚Äì 3.12**  
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD  
- **ruff**, **black**, **mypy**, **bandit**  
- **pytest** for test automation  
- **python-semantic-release** for version management  
- **build** and **twine** for packaging

## üß± GitHub Actions Workflow

Below is the workflow configuration used for this project, located at  
`.github/workflows/python-ci.yaml`:

```yaml
name: CI/CD for simple-http-checker

  push:
    branches: ['main']
  workflow_dispatch:

          mypy --config-file pyproject.toml src/

      - name: Security checks
        run: |
          bandit -c pyproject.toml -r .

          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install ".[dev]"
          pip install python-semantic-release

      - name: Automated tests with Pytest
        run: |
          pytest

  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs:
      - tests
      - lint-static-checks
    steps:
      - name: Release
        run: echo "Release"
```
üß† Purpose

This repository serves as a reference implementation of a modern DevOps pipeline for Python, ensuring:

    High code quality

    Automated security and static checks

    Fully automated versioning and deployment to PyPI

üèóÔ∏è Next Steps

    Add build status and PyPI badges

    Add code coverage reports using coverage.py and Codecov

    Optionally extend the workflow to include Docker image publishing
